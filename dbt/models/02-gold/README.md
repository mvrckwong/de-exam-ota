# Gold Layer Models

## Overview

This directory contains gold layer models that provide business-ready, analytical insights from COVID-19 data. These models are designed to answer specific analytical questions and provide aggregated metrics for reporting and visualization.

The gold layer is built on a dimensional modeling architecture with **`fct_covid_daily`** serving as the core fact table that combines all silver layer data into a unified, analytics-ready structure.

## Naming Conventions (dbt Best Practices)

Following dbt naming conventions, models are prefixed by their purpose:

| Prefix | Purpose | When to Use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `fct_` | **Fact Tables** - Granular, event-level data | Core data with defined grain |
| `agg_` | **Aggregations** - Pre-computed summaries | Performance-optimized summaries |
| `rpt_` | **Reports** - Answer specific business questions | Complex analysis from silver layer |
| `mart_` | **Data Marts** - Business-ready, optimized marts | Simplified queries from fact table |
| `dim_` | **Dimensions** - Descriptive reference data | Lookup tables (future) |

**Note:** No "gold" prefix needed - the folder structure (`02-gold`) defines the layer.

## Architecture

### üèóÔ∏è **CONSISTENT ARCHITECTURE ACHIEVED**

**All gold models now follow the same architectural pattern:**

#### **Single Source of Truth**
- **Fact Table**: `fct_covid_daily` - Central hub for all analytical queries
- **All Models**: Source from `fct_covid_daily` for consistency and performance
- **Pre-calculated Metrics**: Leverage existing calculations for better performance

#### `fct_covid_daily`
**The Single Source of Truth for COVID-19 Analytics**

- **Purpose:** Unified fact table combining US and global COVID-19 data at daily grain
- **Grain:** One row per location per day
- **Data Sources:**
  - US data: State-level daily snapshots
  - Global data: Country/province-level snapshots
  
**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ Surrogate key for unique identification (`fact_key`)
- ‚úÖ Pre-calculated day-over-day changes
- ‚úÖ 7-day rolling averages for trend smoothing
- ‚úÖ Derived metrics (CFR, recovery rate, test positivity)
- ‚úÖ Date dimensions (year, month, week, day of week)
- ‚úÖ Geographic attributes (country, state, coordinates)
- ‚úÖ Severity classifications and trend indicators
- ‚úÖ Fact type classification (additive, semi-additive, non-additive)

**Why Use the Fact Table?**
1. **Performance:** Pre-calculated metrics avoid repeated computations
2. **Consistency:** Single version of truth for all analytics
3. **Simplicity:** Unified structure for both US and global data
4. **Flexibility:** Supports all analytical query patterns
5. **Maintainability:** Changes propagate to all downstream models

**Fact Types in the Table:**
- **Additive Facts:** Can be summed across all dimensions (e.g., `confirmed_cases`, `total_deaths`)
- **Semi-Additive Facts:** Can be summed across some dimensions (e.g., `confirmed_cases_7day_avg`)
- **Non-Additive Facts:** Cannot be summed (e.g., `case_fatality_ratio_pct`, ratios and percentages)

- **Positive Correlation (Testing Rate vs Incident Rate):** Higher testing rates often detect more cases, increasing reported incident rates. This suggests that testing capacity affects case detection.
- **Positive Correlation (Hospitalization vs Mortality):** Higher hospitalization rates correlate with more severe outcomes, indicating the importance of healthcare capacity.
- **Negative Correlation Possible (Cases vs CFR):** More widespread testing (more cases) may show lower fatality ratios as mild cases are detected.

  ALL PRODUCTION MODELS USE FACT TABLE ‚úÖ
```

**Architecture Principle:** The fact table is the **single source of truth** for all production models (aggregations and marts). Report models can access silver directly for exploration and custom analysis, but production dashboards should use models built from the fact table.

## Usage Examples

### Using the Fact Table Directly

```sql
-- Get latest metrics for all locations
SELECT 
    country_region,
    province_state,
    report_date,
    confirmed_cases,
    daily_new_cases,
    case_trend,
    severity_category
FROM {{ ref('fct_covid_daily') }}
WHERE report_date = (SELECT MAX(report_date) FROM {{ ref('fct_covid_daily') }})
ORDER BY confirmed_cases DESC;

-- Time series for specific location
SELECT 
    report_date,
    confirmed_cases,
    daily_new_cases,
    confirmed_cases_7day_avg,
    case_trend
FROM {{ ref('fct_covid_daily') }}
WHERE province_state = 'California'
    AND data_source = 'US'
ORDER BY report_date;

-- Aggregate by country
SELECT 
    country_region,
    SUM(confirmed_cases) as total_cases,
    SUM(total_deaths) as total_deaths,
    AVG(case_fatality_ratio_pct) as avg_cfr
FROM {{ ref('fct_covid_daily') }}
WHERE report_date = '2021-12-31'
GROUP BY country_region
ORDER BY total_cases DESC;
```

### Query Reports

```sql
-- Top countries report
SELECT 
    rank_by_cases,
    country_region,
    total_confirmed_cases,
    pct_of_global_cases,
    severity_tier
FROM {{ ref('rpt_top_countries_by_cases') }}
ORDER BY rank_by_cases;
```

### Query Data Marts

```sql
-- Trends data mart (optimized)
SELECT 
    report_date,
    province_state,
    cases_7day_moving_avg,
    case_trend,
    severity_category
FROM {{ ref('mart_covid_trends') }}
WHERE province_state = 'California'
ORDER BY report_date DESC;
```

### Query Aggregations

```sql
-- Daily national summary
SELECT 
    snapshot_date,
    new_cases_today,
    cases_7day_rolling_avg,
    test_positivity_rate_pct,
    case_trend
FROM {{ ref('agg_daily_summary') }}
ORDER BY snapshot_date DESC
LIMIT 30;
```

## Model Comparison: Reports vs Data Marts

| Aspect | Report Models (rpt_*) | Data Mart Models (mart_*) |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **Source** | Silver layer (direct) | Fact table |
| **Complexity** | More complex transformations | Simpler, leverages pre-calculated metrics |
| **Performance** | Repeated calculations | Pre-calculated metrics |
| **Consistency** | May have calculation differences | Guaranteed consistency |
| **Maintenance** | Changes needed in multiple places | Changes propagate from fact table |
| **Use Case** | Exploration, custom analysis | Production dashboards, regular reporting |
| **Recommendation** | Development and ad-hoc | **Production** ‚≠ê |

**Production Guidance:** Use data marts (`mart_*`) for dashboards and regular reporting. Use reports (`rpt_*`) for exploration and custom analysis.

## Maintenance

- **Dependencies:** 
  - **Fact table** depends on silver layer models
  - **Report models** depend on silver layer (for exploration)
  - **Data mart models** depend on fact table ‚úÖ
  - **Aggregation models** depend on fact table ‚úÖ
  - **All production models** use fact table as single source of truth
- **Refresh Frequency:** Should be refreshed when silver layer is updated
- **Build Order:**
  1. Silver layer models
  2. `fct_covid_daily` (core fact table)
  3. All gold layer models (reports, marts, aggregations)
- **Testing:** Run `dbt test --select 02-gold` to validate data quality

## Tags

Models are tagged for easy selection:

| Tag | Purpose | Models |
|-----|---------|--------|
| `gold` | All gold layer models | All |
| `fact` | Fact table models | `fct_covid_daily` |
| `core` | Core/foundational models | `fct_covid_daily` |
| `report` | Report models | `rpt_*` |
| `mart` | Data mart models | `mart_*` |
| `aggregation` | Pre-computed aggregations | `agg_*` |
| `from_silver` | Built directly from silver | `rpt_*` |
| `from_fact` | Built from fact table | `mart_*` |
| `time_series` | Time-based analysis | Trend models |
| `correlation` | Statistical correlation | Correlation models |
| `top_values` | Frequency/ranking analysis | Top countries models |
| `daily` | Daily grain aggregations | `agg_daily_summary` |
| `state` | State-level aggregations | `agg_state_summary` |
| `country` | Country-level aggregations | `agg_country_summary` |

Run specific tags:
```bash
# Build everything in gold layer
dbt run --select tag:gold

# Build only the fact table
dbt run --select tag:fact

# Build data marts (production models)
dbt run --select tag:mart

# Build reports (exploration models)
dbt run --select tag:report

# Build aggregations
dbt run --select tag:aggregation

# Test all models
dbt test --select tag:gold
```

## Performance Tips

1. **Start with the Fact Table:** Always build `fct_covid_daily` first as it's the foundation
2. **Use Data Marts for Production:** They're optimized and leverage pre-calculated metrics
3. **Use Reports for Exploration:** More flexible for custom analysis
4. **Materialize as Tables:** Gold models are materialized as tables for fast query performance
5. **Incremental Builds:** Consider incremental materialization for very large fact tables
6. **Indexing:** Add indexes on frequently filtered columns (report_date, country_region, province_state)
